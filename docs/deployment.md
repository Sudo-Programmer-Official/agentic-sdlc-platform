YES. This is the correct move. 🔥
Now we lock this down properly so no one (including future you) ever guesses infra again.

You just completed:

Cloudflare → ALB → Target Group → ECS Fargate → Container

Let’s document this cleanly, production-grade.

⸻

📘 Agentic SDLC – Deployment Architecture Documentation

1️⃣ High-Level Architecture

User → Cloudflare (DNS + SSL)
     → AWS ALB (HTTPS 443)
     → Target Group (tg-agentic-web)
     → ECS Service (agentic-web-service)
     → Fargate Task
     → Container (web:80)


⸻

🌐 2️⃣ Domain + DNS Setup (Cloudflare)

Domain

prompt2pr.com
www.prompt2pr.com

DNS Records

Type	Name	Value
CNAME	@	agentic-sdlc-alb-xxxxx.elb.amazonaws.com
CNAME	www	prompt2pr.com

Proxy Mode
	•	Cloudflare proxy enabled (orange cloud)
	•	SSL mode: Full (Strict recommended)

⸻

☁️ 3️⃣ AWS Infrastructure

ALB (Application Load Balancer)

Name:

agentic-sdlc-alb

Scheme:

Internet-facing

Listeners:

Protocol	Port	Action
HTTPS	443	Forward → tg-agentic-web
HTTP	80	Redirect → HTTPS

Certificate:

ACM certificate for api.prompt2pr.com / prompt2pr.com


⸻

🎯 4️⃣ Target Group

Name:

tg-agentic-web

Target Type:

IP

Protocol:

HTTP

Port:

80

Health Check:

Path: /
Protocol: HTTP
Matcher: 200


⸻

🐳 5️⃣ ECS Cluster

Cluster Name:

agentic-sdlc-cluster

Launch Type:

Fargate


⸻

🚀 6️⃣ ECS Service

Service Name:

agentic-web-service

Launch Type:

Fargate

Desired Tasks:

1

Load Balancer Attached:

tg-agentic-web

Container Mapping:

Container name: web
Container port: 80


⸻

📦 7️⃣ Task Definition

Task Definition:

agentic-web-task:2

Container:

Name: web
Image: <your ECR image>
Port mapping: 80
Protocol: TCP

Networking:

awsvpc
Public subnets
Auto-assign public IP (enabled)


⸻

🔐 8️⃣ Security Groups

ALB Security Group

Inbound:

HTTP 80 → 0.0.0.0/0
HTTPS 443 → 0.0.0.0/0

Outbound:

All traffic allowed

ECS Task Security Group

Inbound:

Port 80 → Source: ALB Security Group

Outbound:

All traffic allowed


⸻

🧠 9️⃣ Major Issue We Faced (IMPORTANT)

Problem:

503 Service Temporarily Unavailable

Root Cause:

ECS service was attached to wrong target group (tg-agentic-api)
ALB was forwarding to tg-agentic-web
Mismatch caused 503

Fix:

Updated ECS service to use tg-agentic-web
Redeployed service
Target health became 1 Healthy

Lesson:
ALB target group and ECS service target group must match.

⸻

🔎 10️⃣ Verification Checklist

When debugging 503 in future:
	1.	ALB listener forwarding correct target group
	2.	Target group health shows Healthy
	3.	ECS service attached to same target group
	4.	Container port matches target group port
	5.	App listens on 0.0.0.0 not localhost
	6.	Cloudflare SSL mode correct

⸻

📈 11️⃣ Production Improvements (Next Level)

Future upgrades:

• Enable HTTPS health checks
• Add autoscaling policy
• Add WAF
• Enable ALB access logs
• Add CloudWatch alarms
• Set up CI/CD via GitHub → ECR → ECS
• Add staging environment
• Enable blue/green deployments

⸻

🧾 12️⃣ Suggested Repo Structure for Infra Docs

Create in repo:

/docs/deployment/
    architecture.md
    networking.md
    ecs-setup.md
    cloudflare.md
    troubleshooting.md


⸻

🏁 Final Result

Your site is now:

• Production-grade
• Load-balanced
• Containerized
• Scalable
• TLS secured
• Cloudflare protected

This is real infrastructure.

⸻

If you want, I can now generate:

• A clean Markdown version for GitHub
• A Notion-ready formatted doc
• Or a diagram (Mermaid architecture graph)
• Or Terraform/IaC version

Your infra is now clean. Let’s professionalize it. 🚀
